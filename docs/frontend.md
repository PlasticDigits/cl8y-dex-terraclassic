### Production build — Vite source maps {#vite-production-sourcemaps}

[`frontend-dapp/vite.config.ts`](../frontend-dapp/vite.config.ts) sets `build.sourcemap` from Vite **`mode`**: maps are **off** for the default production build (`vite build`, `mode === 'production'`) and **on** for non-production `vite build --mode …` so staging or custom pipelines can still emit `.js.map` when needed.

| Invariant | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| No public maps in prod | Default `npm run build` output must not ship separate `*.js.map` files that static hosts would serve alongside the bundle (reverses minification for attackers). Tracked in [GitLab #117](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/117). |
| Intentional opt-in for other modes | If you need maps for a non-prod build, use `vite build --mode staging` (or similar), not a change to prod defaults. |
| Ecosystem QA checklist | Row **1.20 (source map leakage)** in `cl8y-ecosystem-qa` `specs/DEX-Security-Checklist-DRAFT.md` should reflect **OK** once this invariant is deployed to the environment under review. |

Regression coverage: [`frontend-dapp/src/viteConfig.build.test.ts`](../frontend-dapp/src/viteConfig.build.test.ts) (loads `vite.config.ts` via `loadConfigFromFile`).

**Third-party / agent context:** [`skills/AGENTS_FRONTEND_PRODUCTION_BUILD.md`](../skills/AGENTS_FRONTEND_PRODUCTION_BUILD.md).

## Wallet Integration

The dApp connects to Terra Classic wallets using the Station browser extension or WalletConnect for mobile. Key considerations:

- **Network detection:** the `VITE_NETWORK` env var controls which chain the dApp targets (`mainnet`, `testnet`, `local`).
- **Signing:** all transactions use the connected wallet's signer. The dApp never handles private keys in production; the Simulated Wallet (dev only) is an exception and is described below.

### Simulated (dev) wallet and `VITE_DEV_MNEMONIC` {#simulated-dev-wallet-and-vite_dev_mnemonic}

When `VITE_DEV_MODE=true`, the UI can offer a **Simulated Wallet** (no browser extension) implemented in [`devWallet.ts`](../frontend-dapp/src/services/terraclassic/devWallet.ts). Invariants:

| Invariant | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| No seed in app source | There is **no** default mnemonic in TypeScript. `VITE_DEV_MNEMONIC` must be supplied at dev time (e.g. `.env.development`, which Vite loads for `vite` / `npm run dev` but not for the default production `vite build`). |
| Same test vector as chain | For LocalTerra, use the same phrase as `TEST_MNEMONIC` in [`docker/init-chain.sh`](../docker/init-chain.sh). `scripts/deploy-dex-local.sh` writes it to `frontend-dapp/.env.development` after deploy. |
| Production build guard | `vite.config.ts` throws if `VITE_DEV_MNEMONIC` is present in the merged production env (prevents inlining a real seed into `dist/`). Tracked in [GitLab #118](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/118). |
| Address in UI | The connected address comes from the `MnemonicWallet` instance (`devWallet.address`), not a hardcoded constant, so a custom dev mnemonic is reflected correctly. |
| Secret scanning | [`.gitleaks.toml`](../.gitleaks.toml) adds a custom rule for BIP39-like quoted phrases under `frontend-dapp/src` (default gitleaks rules do not cover this pattern). |

**Third-party / agent context:** [`skills/AGENTS_BUNDLE_DEV_WALLET.md`](../skills/AGENTS_BUNDLE_DEV_WALLET.md).
- **CW20 allowances:** before `ProvideLiquidity`, the dApp must ensure both CW20 tokens have sufficient allowance for the Pair contract.

### Terra Classic gas limits (router `execute_swap_operations`) {#terra-classic-gas-limits}

The dApp does **not** LCD-simulate every swap before broadcast. Instead, `executeTerraContract` / `executeTerraContractMulti` in [`frontend-dapp/src/services/terraclassic/transactions.ts`](../frontend-dapp/src/services/terraclassic/transactions.ts) set **Cosmos `Fee.gas`** from typed constants in [`frontend-dapp/src/utils/constants.ts`](../frontend-dapp/src/utils/constants.ts). **Underestimating gas causes on-chain `out of gas` after the wallet signs** (users still pay fees for failed txs).

**Formula (pool-only `execute_swap_operations`, no hybrid hop):** for `hops = max(operations.length, 1)`,

`gasWanted = max( round(SWAP_GAS_PER_HOP × hops × SWAP_GAS_BUFFER) + hops × SWAP_MULTIHOP_GAS_PADDING_PER_HOP, hops × EXECUTE_SWAP_OPS_MIN_GAS_PER_HOP )`

Hybrid hops use `max(..., HYBRID_SWAP_GAS_LIMIT × hops)` in `transactions.ts`.

| Invariant | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Buffer tracks chain variance | `SWAP_GAS_BUFFER` must cover wasm execution variance on columbus-5 / LocalTerra; raising it increases **LUNC fee** (`GAS_PRICE_ULUNA × gas`) proportionally — trade off vs reliability. |
| Floor guards multi-hop | `EXECUTE_SWAP_OPS_MIN_GAS_PER_HOP` prevents totals from collapsing when buffer × base is still too small for some hop shapes. |
| Padding absorbs rounding | Per-hop padding exists so totals do not sit exactly on prior “just barely enough” values (historical 2-hop near-miss: ~1,320,097 used vs 1,320,000 wanted). |
| Pool-only regression | Single-hop pool swap `gasWanted` must exceed **753,321** gas used in repro [GitLab #115](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/115) (710k was too low). |

**Operational alignment:** local/mainnet helper scripts use `terrad … --gas-adjustment 1.3` (see `scripts/deploy-dex-local.sh`). The frontend buffer should stay in the same **ballpark** as those CLI defaults so manual ops and the dApp do not diverge wildly.

**Third-party / agent context:** see repository [`skills/AGENTS_TERRACLASSIC_GAS.md`](../skills/AGENTS_TERRACLASSIC_GAS.md) for a short playbook when changing gas constants or debugging `out of gas`.

## Contract Message Format

The frontend uses TerraSwap-compatible message names:

- **Factory:** `create_pair { asset_infos }`, queries `config`, `pair`, `pairs`
- **Pair:** swap via CW20 Send with `{ swap: { belief_price, max_spread, to } }`, provide liquidity via `provide_liquidity { assets }`, withdraw via CW20 Send with `{ withdraw_liquidity: {} }`
- **Queries:** `pool` (reserves + total LP share), `simulation { offer_asset }`, `reverse_simulation { ask_asset }`
- **Types:** `AssetInfo` (`token` or `native_token`), `Asset` (`info` + `amount`), `PairInfo` (`asset_infos`, `contract_addr`, `liquidity_token`)

## Pages

| Route           | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/`             | Swap interface — select tokens, enter amount, swap|
| `/pool`         | View pools, provide/withdraw liquidity            |
| `/create`       | Create a new token pair via the Factory           |
| `/charts`       | Pairs overview and per-pair charts (indexer)      |
| `/trade`        | Trade UI — order book, **price chart**, tape, limits |
| `/trade/:pairAddr` | Same as `/trade` with pair pre-selected       |
| `/limits`       | Limit order placements and lifecycle              |
| `/tiers`        | View fee discount tiers, register/deregister for a tier |

### Trade page — price chart invariants

The **price chart** on `/trade` and `/charts` is rendered with **TradingView [lightweight-charts](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts)** (open-source canvas charting). It is **not** the hosted TradingView terminal/widget product—naming in code review and issues should keep that distinction clear.

| Invariant | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Successful empty candles | `GET /api/v1/pairs/{addr}/candles` may return `[]` or rows that all fail OHLC validation; the UI **must not** show a blank panel. Use the empty state in `PriceChart` + `PriceChartEmptyState`. |
| Single candle | After mapping/filtering, **one** valid OHLC point is enough for lightweight-charts to draw one candlestick; no empty-state for that case. |
| Loading vs empty | While React Query is loading, show the chart loading row; empty state applies only when the request **succeeded** and there are zero valid points. |
| Reference line | When the chart is empty, an optional **24h close** from `getPairStats` (`close_price`) may display; query is enabled only for that state so normal pairs are not blocked. |
| Accessibility | The empty panel uses `role="img"` and a descriptive `aria-label` so screen readers do not see a silent canvas. |

Implementation: [`frontend-dapp/src/components/charts/PriceChart.tsx`](../frontend-dapp/src/components/charts/PriceChart.tsx), [`priceChartCandles.ts`](../frontend-dapp/src/components/charts/priceChartCandles.ts) (pure mapping). Tracked in GitLab [**#113**](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/113).

**Cursor agents:** When iterating on merge readiness and CI for this area, the **Babysit PR** Cursor skill complements the [Testing](./testing.md) doc (comment triage, conflict resolution, green pipelines).

### Pool page — provide liquidity (UI invariants)

The **Provide Liquidity** card mirrors on-chain `provide_liquidity` math for the **Estimated LP** line (see `docs/contracts-terraclassic.md` and `smartcontracts/contracts/pair/src/contract.rs`):

- **First deposit** (both reserves `0`): user LP ≈ `sqrt(amount_a × amount_b) − 1000` LP smallest units (LP CW20 `decimals` = **18**; 1000 = `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` locked forever — see [issue #124](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/124)).
- **Later deposits:** user LP = `min(amount_a × total_share / reserve_a, amount_b × total_share / reserve_b)` (integer floor on each term, then `min`).

**Wallet balance queries** use the same React Query key prefix as the Swap page: `['tokenBalance', address, <asset id>]`, where the asset id is the CW20 `terra1…` address or, when “Use native (auto-wrap)” is checked, the bank **denom** string (e.g. `uluna`), via `getTokenBalance` in `src/services/terraclassic/queries.ts`.

**Ratio warning:** if the two typed amounts are not in the current pool price ratio, the contract still executes, but the **smaller** LP term sets the mint; the excess on the other side is effectively donated to the pool (same as Astroport/TerraSwap behavior).

E2E for pool flows runs with the dev-wallet fixture; Playwright worker count is pinned in [`.cursor/rules/playwright-workers.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/playwright-workers.mdc) (5 workers) to keep the Vite `webServer` stable.

| GitLab | Role |
|--------|------|
| [#109](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/109) | Add-LP balances, Max / 50%, LP estimate, tests |
| [#112](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/112) | Pool list: indexer vs factory, router badges, filter |

### Liquidity pools list (indexer vs factory) {#liquidity-pools-list-indexer-vs-factory}

The pool list (`/pool`) is **sourced and sorted** by the [indexer](./indexer-invariants.md) `GET /api/v1/pairs` API. That order is **not** the on-chain factory’s `pairs` cursor order.

**Invariants (dApp):**

| Invariant | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| “N pair(s) (indexer total)” | Total from the indexer (pagination + sort params). |
| “M on-chain (factory, router graph)” | Number of `PairInfo` rows returned by paginating the factory’s `pairs` query (capped; see `FACTORY_PAIRS_MAX_FOR_POOL_LIST` in `pairListBadges.ts`). This is the same set the Swap page loads for `findRoute` / BFS. |
| Row badge **In router (factory)** | The pair’s `pair_address` is in that factory-derived `Set` — **O(1)** per row; **no** per-card `pair` query to the factory. |
| Row badge **Indexer only** | Address not in the factory list for this page session (e.g. indexing ahead of factory registration, de-listed pair still in indexer, or address outside the factory fetch cap). |
| “Indexer only” filter | Restricts the **current page** of indexer results to rows that appear in the factory set. |

**Drift line:** If indexer total and factory list length differ, the page shows a short **status** note (indexing lag, caps, or allowlist effects).

**Query strategy:** One React Query for `getAllPairsPaginated(FACTORY_PAIRS_MAX_FOR_POOL_LIST)` (stale time 60s), shared conceptually with Swap’s on-chain graph but **separate** query key (`factoryPairsForPoolList`) to avoid clashing with Swap’s default `maxPairs` limit.

**Code:** `frontend-dapp/src/utils/pairListBadges.ts`, `frontend-dapp/src/pages/PoolPage.tsx`. Issue: [glab#112](https://gitlab.com/PlasticDigits/cl8y-dex-terraclassic/-/issues/112).

**Agent workflow (optional):** For reviewable follow-up PRs or merge-ready checks in Cursor, use the **split to PRs** and **babysit** skills from your [Cursor skills](https://docs.cursor.com/context/skills) path (e.g. `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/` on a developer machine).

## Fee Discount Service

The `feeDiscount.ts` service in `src/services/` handles all interactions with the fee-discount contract:

**Queries:**
- `getConfig()` — returns governance address and CL8Y token address
- `getDiscount(trader)` — returns the trader's current discount in basis points
- `getTier(tierId)` — returns a single tier's details (min tokens, discount bps)
- `getTiers()` — returns all configured tiers
- `getRegistration(wallet)` — returns the wallet's current tier registration (or null)
- `isTrustedRouter(router)` — checks if an address is a trusted router

**Executions:**
- `register(tierId)` — self-register for a tier (EOA only)
- `deregister()` — remove own registration

### Swap Page Integration

The Swap page displays the effective fee after discount. When a connected wallet has a registered tier, the UI shows:
- The base pair fee (e.g., 0.30%)
- The discount percentage from the trader's tier
- The effective fee after discount (e.g., 0.15% for a 50% discount)

### Tiers Page

The `/tiers` page allows users to:
- View all available discount tiers with CL8Y requirements
- See their current CL8Y balance and eligible tiers
- Register for a tier (sends a `Register` transaction)
- Deregister from their current tier
- View their active registration status
